# ChatNet
 ChatNet develops a chat application using TCP/IP to enable reliable message exchange between two machines. It handles packet loss, avoids duplicates, and ensures message ordering using TCP-like retransmission. The app also supports simultaneous text and file transfer, with synchronization for reconnecting peers.
